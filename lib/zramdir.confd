# zramdir can put several directories to a zram backed block device;
# this init service require lz4 compressor, or else edit compressor
#

# root directory or mount point
zramdir_root=/var/tmp

# compressed and restored directories when starting/stoping service
# to keep fs consistencies (colon separated list)
compressed_dir=/var/log

# contrary to the previous one, fs does not keep consistency upon restart
uncompressed_dir=

# set the compressor to use
compressor="lz4 -1 -"
